              The number of crimes in the world is increasing day by day [1]. No matter 
how much the security forces efforts, they have not been able to control it or reduce 
the amount of crime. Sri Lanka has been huge topic within few years due to inflation 
and it is shown that the crime rates have been increasing rapidly within just first few 
months into the year 2022. [21] This is a serious threat to the safety of the entire public. 
It is an unfortunate fact that technology has not been actively used to maintain peace 
in society, though having huge advancement in technology field. It has been proven 
that trying to fight crime using only human labor for many years is futile. Despite 
having surveillance systems in common places and across streets and being monitored 
for 24 hours, they are no affects to crime rates. If a crime or an offence can be identified 
with the help of computer vison before occurs or while happening the destruction can 
be reduced or even avoided if we can informed the relevant security officers faster. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Crimes happen due to many reasons and emotions are one of them. These 
emotions are much expressive through facial features and hard to hide. A person 
indicates a specific pattern of behavior and emotions in preparation for committing a 
crime while committing a crime and after committed a crime. These can be detected 
through CCTV footages. These facial expressions may missed by security officials 
since only one subject can be monitored at once. A person's inner thoughts and 
intentions are often expressed through the face in such cases.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Facial expressions recognition is being a trending topic for a while and many 
              methodology has been invented. However emotion recognition is not widely famous 
              with the topic of crime detection and it rare to find solutions built using FER for crime 
              detection and in security field.

                  It has been confirmed that the amount of crime in Sri Lanka has increased due to severe 
inflation and economic crisis. The Sri Lanka Police Information Technology Division was 
established in 1993. Currently, it is expanding further and has established a separate unit called 
CCTV division. This CCTV division monitors the CCTV cameras located by Sri Lanka Police at main 
intersections of the Colombo city. However, this method is not very effective because it 
consumes a lot of human labor and time. And also, the CCTV cameras placed like that are not of 
very good quality. Therefore, it is very difficult to identify people through those cameras at 
night. Even though, people can be observed through the CCTV camera during the day time, the 
CCTV division members do not have the ability to identify suspicious behaviors of the people. 
Distinguishing between normal behavior and suspicious behavior using the human eyes is a
very difficult task. Therefore, crimes are often prosecuted only after they have occurred. A 
system to detect and prevent a crime in advance has not been established in connection with 
CCTV. It is a threat to the safety of the entire society. Hence, the need for an automated CCTV 
suspicious behavior system has emerged. Following figure shows the problems Sri Lanka Police 
and the law enforcement face in detecting a crime using the human eyes not only during the 
day time but also during the night time, and it is evident that lot of people prefer to work with a 
real time CCTV suspicious behavior detection system in order to prevent crime from happening 
from the first place.

                  ThirdEYE is a solution to detect crimes and offences, while happening or 
                  before happens. The key idea is to reduce damages happening due to crimes. Emotion 
                  recognition will aid on detecting crimes and offences in public areas. We use main 4 components to do this which are Facial Expression Classification,
                  Weapon Detection Behavior Classification methods and Face Identification. The System is build build to allow real time detection and alerting. To Achive this we uses light weight classification 
                  model such as Mobilenet and Yolo.

                Due to the rising crime rates in Sri Lanka consequents of inflation and other 
                factors safety is huge concern and statistics show that though installment of 
                surveillance systems crime rate has no affects because of the security controls. To 
                address these issues crime detection and recognition system is proposed to assist law 
                enforcement officers. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">
                Proposed system that takes inputs from surveillance cameras and is capable of 
                providing real time prediction using computer vison and accurate details in terms of 
                safety and security of a specific place’s public and properties is proposed to 
                implement. A mobile application and a web application and is required for informing 
                security officials and to provide other services such as storing data related to specific 
                crime detected.

                      Face Detection is one of the crusial first step for facial expression classification in CCTV footages. Trained CNN with less inference time is used for detection and detected faces are fed into a compact light weight classificaton model 
                      to classify facial expression into emotion classes. Then these emotions are used to get the possibility of a crime with the results of other components.

              The system will take sequences of images through a Wifi camera that allows the system to traffic each frame of the live video input of the camera through a local Area network using 
              RTSP protocol. The system work as a web server application on an edge divice(Rasberry Pi). This allows us to connect the frontend to receive live video feed to provide
              a streaming service to users. Each Frames are run through the Flask Backend which works as the web application inside the edge device. A RESTFUL API is configured to recieve real time frame by frame output of
              detection and classification models for monitoring purposes. Application allows to detect and classify above components in real 
              time. Once the application is run despite of not calling any APIs or not accessing the configured endpoints the system is able to do crime detection using threading techniques.
              This allow the system to alert related officials if a potential of crime is detected independently.
